# What is this?
This is the documentation and project page for Official_IDEP_art's Light containment zone, or creepycreep555's light containment zone remake. light containment zone remake contains all the code information inside of the project, so all the documentation will mostly be on it. It also has a couple more features that are mod compatible.
